# Kitchenware-Classification

# Enviroment
I'll use a conda enviroment for this project.
## Create a conda enviroment
```bash
conda create -n mlbookcamp python=3.9.15
```
## Activate the enviroment
```bash
conda activate mlbookcamp
```
## Install ipykernel
```bash
conda install ipykernel
```
## Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# tf-serving-connect
Working on [tf-serving-connect.ipynb](notebooks/tf-serving-connect.ipynb).


I'll try with an amazon picture. It looks like it's working because it was predicting well.
## Testing as a docker-container
```sh
    docker run -it --rm `
    -p 8500:8500 `
    -v "C:\Users\User\Desktop\Github\kitchenware-classification\kitchen-model:/models/kitchen-model/1" `
    -e MODEL_NAME=kitchen-model `
    tensorflow/serving:2.3.0
```

`Entering the event loop` means that is working well.
# Gateway
## Proto
Working on [proto.py](proto.py) because we're going use some functions from there.

The gateway will be serve on a Flask application. [Code](gateway.py)
## Run the gateway (using an example)
```sh
python gateway.py 
```
## Run the gateway (using [test.py](test.py))
```sh
python gateway.py
```

It's working as intended.

# Docker-compose
## Gateway Dockerfile
I'll create a dockerfile for the gateway
```docker
FROM python:3.9.15

RUN pip install pipenv

WORKDIR /app 

COPY ["Pipfile", "Pipfile.lock", "./"]

RUN pipenv install --system --deploy

COPY ["gateway.py", "proto.py", "./"]

EXPOSE 9696

ENTRYPOINT [ "gunicorn", "--bind=0.0.0.0:9696", "gateway:app" ]
```
## Build Dockerfile
```sh
docker build -t kitchen-gateway:001 -f image-gateway.Dockerfile .
```
## Test it
```sh
docker run -it --rm `
-p 9696:9696 `
kitchen-gateway:001
```
## Model Dockerfile
I'll create a model service.
```docker
FROM tensorflow/serving:2.7.0

COPY kitchen-model /models/kitchen-model 
ENV MODEL_NAME="kitchen-model"
```
## Build Dockerfile
```sh
docker build -t kitchen-model:001 -f image-model.Dockerfile .
```
## Docker-Compose code
```
version: "3.9"
services:
  kitchen-model:
    image: kitchen-model:001
  gateway:
    image: kitchen-gateway:001 
    environment:
      - TF_SERVING_HOST=kitchen-model:8500
    ports:
      - "9696:9696"
```
## Build Docker-Compose
```
docker-compose up
```
